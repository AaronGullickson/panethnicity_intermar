- Sneak Preview: Showing you the punchline figure at the beginning. 
- Obviously a lot going on here that I will get into in the talk
  - Changes across two points in time in "racial" boundaries
  - if you look carefully not all of these boundaries would be classified as race or at least "big" race
- Lot of interesting stuff here that I will highlight later

---

## Two Projects

???

- Combination of two different projects
- The first project is the development of a new(ish) approach to modeling assortative mating
  - An intuitive alternative to the traditional log-linear approach
  - Happy to say that I now have an article forthcoming in *Demographic Research* that outlines the new technique
- The second project looks at changes in interracial marriage in the United States
  - Made possible by recent changes in Census questions that allow us to measure timing of marriage
  - looking at two points in time (1980 and 2013-2018)
  - Specific focus on questions of pan-ethnicity

## Why Should We Care About Interracial Marriage?

???

- Measure of social boundaries
  - long considered the best indicator of the strength of social boundaries that define and separate groups
  - committed intergroup interaction in the most intimate realm of life
  - extensive work on the assimilation of Euroethnics, for example, has used intermarriage as a key signifier, but also as a causal mechanism...
- Challenge
  - Measure of existing strength but also presents an incipient challenge to existing boundaries. 
  - mixed-race children in the next generation. How will they be identified and classified? Be clear its a challenge but not an insurmountable one to existing systems (i.e. one-drop rule).
  - integrates extended family/kin networks.

## How Do We Measure Prevalence of Intermarriage?

--

.pull-left[
### Log-Linear Models

We first create a cross-tabulation of husbands' and wives' characteristics:

|           |W Group 1|W Group 2|W Group 3|
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
|H Group 1  | $F_{11}$| $F_{12}$| $F_{13}$|
|H Group 2  | $F_{21}$| $F_{22}$| $F_{23}$|
|H Group 3  | $F_{31}$| $F_{32}$| $F_{33}$|

We then predict the counts within each cell by maginal and joint parameters:

$$\log(F_{ij})=\lambda+\lambda_i+\lambda_j+\lambda_{ij}$$

### Benefits and Drawbacks

`r emo::ji("+1")` Marginal distributions account for group size<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` The *unmarried exclusion bias*<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Assumes a single marriage market<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Non-intuitive and complex<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Handles quantitative variables (e.g. age) poorly<br>
]

---

## A Counterfactual Approach

--

1. For each actual union, randomly choose one spouse.

--

2. For the chosen spouse, sample $j$ alternate partners that are drawn from the population of **single and recently married** individuals from the **same geographic** region.

--

3. Use a conditional logit model to look at how partner characteristics affect the likelihood of the actual union within the choice set. Examples could be:
  - age differences
  - educational homogamy, hypergamy, and hypogamy
  - racial exogamy
  - language endogamy

--

#### Benefits and Drawbacks of this Approach

`r emo::ji("+1")` Implicitly addresses "supply" issue in partner characteristics through sampling<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Allows for a tight specification of the marriage market<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Includes the single population in the pool of potential partners<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Easy to model using standard linear model framework<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Computationally intensive to sample partners<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Requires detailed marriage formation data

## How Do Partner Age Differences Affect Likelihood of Marriage?

                                coef_table$model=="+ both" &
                                coef_table$data=="ACS 2014-18"]

odds <- exp(age_linear*agediff+
              age_squared*(agediff^2))
max_age_diff <- age_linear/(-2*age_squared)

ggplot(data.frame(agediff, odds), aes(x=agediff, y=odds))+
  geom_line(size=2)+

             size=3)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, size=1, linetype=3)+

### Constructing Analytical Data
- Marriages restricted to:
    - Those formed within the last five years.
    - Both spouses were present in the same state for the last five years.
- Pool of eligible partners restricted to:
    - Currently single individuals and those married in the last five years.
    - Present in the same state for the last five years.
- I sample 25 alternative partners for one randomly selected marriage partner to create choice sets.

## What does the model control for?

- Age differences
- Education differences
- Birthplace endogamy
- Language endogamy
- Native/immigrant preferences

???

- show where pan-ethnic parameters line up
- black intermarriage still the most likely although gains over time
- only decreases are for Indigenous and Asian Indian populations
