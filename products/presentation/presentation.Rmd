## Two Projects

???

- Combination of two different projects
- The first project is the development of a new(ish) approach to modeling assortative mating
  - An intuitive alternative to the traditional log-linear approach
  - Happy to say that I now have an article condtionally accepted in *Demographic Research* that outlines the new technique
- The second project looks at changes in interracial marriage in the United States
  - Made possible by recent changes in Census questions that allow us to measure timing of marriage
  - looking at two points in time (1980 and 2014-2018)
  - Specific focus on the issue of pan-ethnicity among Asian and Latino national-origin/ethnic groups

## Why Should We Care About Interracial Marriage?

???

- Measure of social boundaries
  - long considered the best indicator of the strength of social boundaries that define and separate groups
  - committed intergroup interaction in the most intimate realm of life
  - extensive work on the assimilation of Euroethnics, for example, has used intermarriage as a key signifier, but also as a causal mechanism...
- Challenge
  - Measure of existing strength but also presents an incipient challenge to existing boundaries. 
  - mixed-race children in the next generation. How will they be identified and classified? Be clear its a challenge but not an insurmountable one to existing systems (i.e. one-drop rule).
  - integrates extended family/kin networks.

???

* Ethnoracial pentagon
  * coined by historian David Hollinger
  * describes the increasingly taken for granted categorization of the US into five racial categories, supported by state practices and social norms
  * The categories are quite similar to original color-coded taxonomic categories of Blumenbach: White, Black, Red, Yellow, and Brown (with caveats on brown)
  * I have used the term "big race" to describe these categories as a parallel to Grusky and Weeden's "big class" concept

---

.center[
![](images/pentagon_4.svg)
]

???

* Pan-ethnicity is often used in reference to the clear national-origin ("ethnic") distinctions among groups that make up the Asian and Latino categories.
* Pan-ethnicity is the tendency towards identifying with the larger umbrella category of Asian or Latino in contrast to other lower-level distinctions.
* Pan-ethnicity should be a surprising outcome - nationality produces strong identities.
* Asian and Latino pan-ethnicity is thought to have increased with the growth of these populations in the US, because of:
  * state actions to categorize and count
  * ethnic entrepreneurs
  * identity-based organizations (e.g. National Council of La Raza)
* Intermarriage is often thought of as an excellent measure of the degree of pan-ethnicity among groups. 

---

.center[
![](images/pentagon_3.svg)
]

???

* While pan-ethnicity among Asians and Latinos is the most historically salient, we can think of similar consolidation occurring for each of the other categories in the racial pentagon.
  * most well-studied is the creation (or expansion) of whiteness from a variety of European ethnic groups who often had great antipathy toward one another. 
  * similar process occurred even earlier for blacks in the US, where the institution of slavery was a powerful vehicle for assimilation. 
  * process has been more partial and complex for indigenous populations. Some strong tribal connections mixed with a large population without any strong tribal identity.

---

.center[
![](images/pentagon_2.svg)
]

???

* In the lingo of boundary formation theory, we can think of pan-ethnicity more generally as a case of boundary expansion: Pushing back the level of important boundaries to a higher level.
  * Each form of boundary expansion however has unique features that have contributed to the present dynamics of race in the US.
  * white boundary expansion was part of a process of nation-building.
  * black and indigenous boundary expansion was part of a process of ethnogenesis, but with opposing rules in how to handle mixed offspring.

---

.center[
![](images/pentagon_1.svg)
]

???

* The distinction between older projects of boundary expansion and contemporary pan-ethnicity is about timing. The original "triangle" of American race relations has been extended to two more recent entries.
* Asian and Latino boundary expansion is an ongoing project and the boundaries between national-origin groups are "brighter". 
* There are some important differences between the Asian and Latino case to be aware of:
    * Latinos connected by single language, but Asians are not.
    * Latino classification has resisted racialization more than Asian case.
    * "model minority" status of Asian Americans as well as class advantages.

.center[
![](images/pentagon_0.svg)
]

???

* It is worth noting that certain identifications still don't fit well within this racial pentagon. 
  * MENA category (itself a pan-ethnic designation). They are supposed to check white.
  * South Asians - Generally classified as Asian, but "Asian" in the US is often used to references someone of east of southeast Asian origin, and thus South Asians don't quite fit.

## How Do We Measure Prevalence of Intermarriage?

--

.pull-left[
### Log-Linear Models

We first create a cross-tabulation of husbands' and wives' characteristics:

|           |W Group 1|W Group 2|W Group 3|
|-----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|H Group 1  | $F_{11}$| $F_{12}$| $F_{13}$|
|H Group 2  | $F_{21}$| $F_{22}$| $F_{23}$|
|H Group 3  | $F_{31}$| $F_{32}$| $F_{33}$|

We then predict the counts within each cell by marginal and joint parameters:

$$\log(F_{ij})=\lambda+\lambda_i+\lambda_j+\lambda_{ij}$$
]

???

* Note that the log-linear model can incorporate more dimensions here.

.pull-right[
### Benefits and Drawbacks

`r emo::ji("+1")` Marginal distributions account for group size<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` The *unmarried exclusion bias*<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Assumes a single marriage market<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Non-intuitive and complex<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Handles quantitative variables (e.g. age) poorly<br>
]


---

## A Counterfactual Approach

--

1. For each actual union, randomly choose one spouse.

--

2. For the chosen spouse, sample $j$ alternate partners that are drawn from the population of **single and recently married** individuals from the **same geographic** region.

--

3. Use a conditional logit model to look at how partner characteristics affect the likelihood of the actual union within the choice set. Examples could be:
  - age differences
  - educational homogamy, hypergamy, and hypogamy
  - racial exogamy
  - language endogamy

--

#### Benefits and Drawbacks of this Approach

`r emo::ji("+1")` Implicitly addresses group size differences through sampling<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Allows for a better specification of the marriage market<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Includes the single population in the pool of potential partners<br>
`r emo::ji("+1")` Easy to model using the standard linear model framework<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Computationally intensive to sample partners<br>
`r emo::ji("-1")` Requires detailed marriage formation data

* We pull four alternate wives for Lance from single or recently married women.
* We chose husband randomly. In other cases we choose the wife and alternate husbands.
* heterosexuality bias: possible to build this model for LGBT couples as well but some additional complexities. Happy to talk about it in Q&A.

## How Do Partner Age Differences Affect Likelihood of Marriage?

```{r age-graph}
agediff <- seq(from=-20, to=20, by=0.1)
age_linear <- coef_table$coef[coef_table$variable=="age difference" &
                                coef_table$model=="+ both" &
                                coef_table$data=="ACS 2014-18"]
age_squared <- coef_table$coef[coef_table$variable=="age difference squared" &
                                coef_table$model=="+ both" &
                                coef_table$data=="ACS 2014-18"]

odds <- exp(age_linear*agediff+
              age_squared*(agediff^2))
max_age_diff <- age_linear/(-2*age_squared)

ggplot(data.frame(agediff, odds), aes(x=agediff, y=odds))+
  geom_line(size=2)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.25))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_age_diff, linetype=1, color="red",
             size=3)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, size=1, linetype=3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size=1, linetype=3)+
  annotate("text", x=11, y=0.5, 
           label="Likelihood is maximized when\nhusband is 2.16 years older than wife",
           size=7, family="indie-flower", angle=9, color="grey35")+
  labs(x="Husband's age minus wife's age", 
       y="Odds of union relative to partners of the same age")
```

???

* Go through details
  * I am fitting a parabolic function here to see where the maximum likelihood is. 
  * Note that an odds of one is when spouses are equal age.
  * The "offset" of the parabola indicates the (slight) preference for husbands being older than wives.

### Constructing Analytical Data
- Marriages restricted to:
    - Those formed within the last five years.
    - Both spouses were present in the same state for the last five years.
- Pool of eligible partners restricted to:
    - Currently single individuals and those married in the last five years.
    - Present in the same state for the last five years.
- I sample 25 alternative partners **from same state** for one randomly selected marriage partner to create choice sets.
]

???

* The restrictions on being in-state also mean that foreign-born respondents are only included if they were married in the US. 
* in-state sampling resolves problem of using a national marriage market.
* inclusion of single invidiuals resolves the unmarried exclusion bias.

* Each color corresponds to a dummy variable in the model.
* All parameters are gender symmetric.

???

* These are the racial/ethnic categories that can be identified on both the ACS and the 1980 Census. More available if we just take ACS, but I want comparability.
* One partner on the row and the other on the column. 
* Terms are gender-symmetric so only need to look at coding one way.
* Endogamous unions are the reference.
* I block code all ethnic exogamy between Latinos and Asians using a single dummy variable, respectively. I am not looking at specific affinities between certain ethnic groups.
* I separate out Asian Indians as a group because of their racial ambiguity. 

---

## What does the model control for?

--

#### Age Differences

I include the age difference between partners and its square.

--

#### Education Differences

I use a "crossing" model to code the distance between four educational categories: 
* Less than high school
* High school diploma
* Some college, but no four-year degree
* Four-year college degree or more.

I also include variables for female educational hypergamy and hypogamy (i.e. upward and downward marriage).

--

#### Birthplace and Language Endogamy

I include two variables that measure two additional forms of endogamy:
* Were partners born in the same country or not?
* Do partners speak the same primary language?

---

* Language Endogamy

--

  * For Asians, language is highly correlated with ethnicity/nationality and thus language endogamy should reduce the tendency toward ethnic exogamy.
  
--
  
  * For Latinos, language is often the same across ethnicity/nationality and thus language endogamy may increase the tendency toward ethnic exogamy.

--

* Birthplace Endogamy

--

  * For both groups, birthplace endogamy should reduce the tendency toward ethnic exogamy.

## Asian Ethnic Exogamy is Much Higher When Accounting for Language and Birthplace Endogamy

Walk through basic features:
* outcome is the odds of ethnic intermarriage (e.g. Japanese and Korean) vs ethnically endogamous union (e.g. Japanese and Japanese). 
* Bottom model does not control for language and birthplace endogamy. I then control for them separately and then jointly in subsequent model. 
* You can think of the later models as asking "how much ethnic exogamy would there be if all Asians spoke the same language and were born in the same country?"

## Conclusions

--

* Ethnic intermarriage among Asians and Latinos appears to be moderate and has not increased over time, but language and birthplace endogamy complicate the story.

--

   * For Asians, language and birthplace endogamy are significant barriers to ethnic intermarriage. Once these are held constant, Asian ethnic intermarriage **has** increased over time and is common today.

--

   * For Latinos, accounting for language and birthplace endogamy has little effect on ethnic intermarriage. Latino ethnic intermarriage is even less common today than Latino/White intermarriage. 

--

* `r emo::ji("open_mouth")` **Somewhat Surprising Finding**: Stronger evidence of pan-ethnicity among Asians than Latinos. Why might this be?

--

  * Stronger racialization of Asian populations?
  
--

* Other findings:
  * Black intermarriage remains the rarest form of intermarriage, but has increased over time. 
  * Indigenous and Asian Indian intermarriage has decreased over time, but this may result from measurement issues.
