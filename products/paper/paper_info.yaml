abstract: In this paper, I use a newly developed counterfactual marriage model to estimate changes in racial and ethnic exogamy in newly formed marriages between the 1980 Census and 2014-2018 American Community Survey data. I pay particular attention to the degree of pan-ethnicity between Hispanic and Asian national origin groups. The results show that controlling for birthplace and language endogamy have important implications for the measurement of ethnic exogamy generally, but more strongly for Asians than for Hispanics. Ethnic exogamy is much stronger for Asians than for Hispanics. Hispanic ethnic exogamy in the later time period is less common than Hispanic/White exogamy. Results also demonstrate a perpetuation of a strong black/non-black divide in intermarriage.
