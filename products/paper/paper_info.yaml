abstract: I use a newly developed counterfactual marriage model to estimate changes in racial and ethnic exogamy for newly formed marriages based on 1980 Census and 2014-2018 American Community Survey data. I pay particular attention to the degree of pan-ethnicity between Hispanic and Asian national origin groups, measured by the degree of ethnic exogamy. I find that ethnic exogamy is much more common among Asian than Hispanic ethnic groups. While Asian ethnic exogamy has increased over time, Hispanic ethnic exogamy has been stable over time. In the later time period Hispanic ethnic exogamy is less common than exogamy between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. I also find that controlling for birthplace and language endogamy has important implications for the measurement of ethnic exogamy generally, but more strongly for Asians than for Hispanics. Finally, I also find a perpetuation of a strong black/non-black divide in intermarriage.
