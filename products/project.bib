	volume = {97},
	abstract = {According to classical works on social stratification, status homogamy can be regarded as an indicator of the 'openness' of society. In contrast to previous approaches, this article treats marriages choice as a multidimensional penomenon and makes a distinction between ascriptive- and achievement-oriented characteristics. Ascriptive status homogamy is measured by the similarity of spouses with respect to their father's occupational class, while the achieved dimension of status homogamy is measured by the similarity of spouses' educational attainment. Multivariate log-linear models are used to explore the relative importance of these factors for the choice of spouse, and the article tests the hypothesis that there has been a transition from ascription to achievement in patterns of marriage selection. This study first demonstrates empirically that previously conducted synthetic cohort analyses of educational homogamy suffer from selection biases and then, using the Occupational Change in a Generation surveys, analyzes two real marriage cohorts. The analyses show that education is a more important boundary in marriage selection than social-class origins and that educational homogamy has increased over time. At the same time, there is some indication that ascription has become a less important boundary in marriage selection.},

	abstract = {Although black/white intermarriage was a prominenet indicator of race relations in the 1960s and early 1970s, the topic seems to have been low on the academic agenda during the 1980s. Many studies are currently being done on black/white differences in income, employment, education, and residence, but there is insufficient recent information on intermarriage. To fill this gap, I examine annual marriage license data for 33 states from 1968 to 1986 to assess how the role of the black/white color line in marriage choice has changed. The analyses generally show that black white intermarriage has increased rapidly since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the legal ban on intermarriage. I further show that this trend is especially pronounced among black males and that the status characteristics of these marriages have remained traditional in the sense that intermarriage still occurs primarily when the white woman marries up in socioeconomic status. In my conclusion, I offer several interpretations of why the link between status and interracial marriage persists, and discuss what this implies for the nature of racial differentiation in contemporary American society.},

	abstract = {People have a tendency to marry within their social group or to marry a person who is close to them in status. Although many characteristics play a role in the choice of a spouse, sociologists have most often examined endogamy and homogamy with respect ot race/ethnicity, religion, and socioeconomic status. I first give an overview of hypotheses on the causes of endogamy and homogamy. The various hypotheses that have been suggested in the literature can be distinguished as arguments about three more general factors: (a) the preferences of marriage candidates for certain characteristics in a spouse, (b) the interference of third parties in the selection process, and (c) the constraints of the marriage market in which candiates are searching for a spouse. Second, I summarize empirical research by answering four questions: (a) To what extent are groups endogamous and how do groups differ in this respect, (b) How has endogamy changed over time? (c) Which factors are related to endogamy? (d) How do various dimensions of partner choices coincide? Third, I discuss strengths and weaknesses of past research. Strengths include the mass of descriptive work that has been done and the development of a multifaceted theoretical perspective which gives sociological theorizing an edge over psychological and economic theories of partner choice. Weaknesses include the lack of standardization of methods in describing patterns and trends and the relatively weak integration of empirical and theoretical work.},

Some recent studies, however, challenge this view. We test the thesis with multinomial logit regression using data on black-white marriages in the US and Canada. We find modest support for the theory in the US but not in Canada. In the US, white women married to African American men are somewhat more likely to marry up on education than white women in same-race marriages, but the same pattern is not observed when the intermarriage involves Caribbean blacks and whites. These statistically significant tendencies, however, reflect rather modest differences in the proportion of couples in interracial marriages with different educational levels compared to those found among same-race couples.},

According to the stereotype, such women would partner with comparatively less-attractive men who are comparatively high in socioeconomic status. I found little support for beauty-status exchange, and this limited support lacked robustness. Gullickson critiques my analysis on two grounds, arguing against the difference-based regression models, and proposing a new specification of interaction effects in the log-linear models. However, the difference models conceptualize exchange as defined in the relevant literature, and Gullickson’s modified difference models only replicate my conventional regression models, providing no new evidence for or against beauty-status exchange. Likewise, Gullickson’s proposed log-linear specifications are not only non-hierarchical, they also fail to improve model fit or to support exchange when using alternative measures of status. Indeed, Gullickson focuses on the only measure of status that yields any support for beauty-status exchange. Altogether, Gullickson’s case for beauty-status exchange overlooks the preponderance of contrary evidence and prioritizes statistical significance, attainable only under narrow model specifications, over robustness and model fit.},

	abstract = {Using census data, we compare patterns of interracial marriage in six different contexts where immigration has played a central role in population composition. We use Kalmijn's (1998) general theoretical perspective that emphasizes how opportunity structures and third-party factors affect inter-group marriage rates. More specifically, we hypothesize that rates of intermarriage are influenced by: (1) structural opportunities as reflected by the history of inequality, segregation, and racial oppression, (2) third-party interests such as cultural and linguistic differences, and (3) societal trends that reflect choices in the formation of intimate relationships and racial equality. We use age as a surrogate for the trends over time. We first estimate log-linear models to gauge the extent of overall homogamy and race specific homogamy in each cultural setting. We then use multinomial logistic regression to evaluate age differences. Cross-cultural differences in rates of intermarriage are substantial. Intermarriage is more common in societies where structural opportunities for contact are high and third-party interests low (Hawaii and New Zealand), almost non-existent among some groups in societies where the strong inter-group tensions remain, (Xinjiang Province, China and South Africa), and intermediate in societies with moderate degrees of opportunities and third-party interests (United States and Canada). Age is generally negatively associated with intermarriage, with some interesting exceptions. Interracial marriage in general is becoming more common in the arenas we examine. A partir de données de recensement, nous comparons des modèles de mariages interraciaux dans six différents contextes où l'immigration a joué un rôle central dans la composition de la population. Nous nous servons de la perspective théorique générale de Kalmijn (1998) qui souligne comment les structures occasionnelles et les facteurs de tiers affectent le taux des mariages entre groupes. Plus spécifiquement, nous formulons l'hypothèse que les taux d'intermariages sont influencés par: 1) les structures occasionnelles qui se manifestent dans l'histoire de l'inégalité, de la ségrégation et de l'oppression raciale; 2) les intérêts de tiers telles que les différences culturelles et linguistiques; et 3) les tendances sociétales qui reflètent des choix dans la formation de relations intimes et d'égalité raciale. Nous utilisons l'âge comme un élément représentatif de ces tendances dans le temps. Nous considérons d'abord des modèles log-linéaires pour mesurer l'étendue de l'homogamie en général et de l'homogamie de race spécifique dans chaque cadre culturel. Nous utilisons ensuite la régression logistique multinomiale pour évaluer les différences d'âge. Les différences cross-culturelles dans les taux d'intermariages sont substantielles. Les intermariages sont plus communs dans les sociétés où les occasions structurales de contact sont élevées et les intérêts de tiers bas (Hawaii et Nouvelle-Zélande), quasi inexistants dans quelques groupes appartenant à des sociétés où se manisfestent de fortes tensions entre groupes (Province de Xinjiang, Chine et Afrique du Sud) et de fréquence moyenne dans des sociétés où les occasions de contact et les intérêts de tiers sont modérés (Etats-Unis et Canada). L'âge est généralement associé négativement à l'intermariage, avec quelques exceptions intéressantes. En général, le mariage interracial devient plus commun dans les contextes que nous examinons. Mediante el uso de datos censales, comparamos modelos de matrimonios interraciales en seis contextos en que la inmigración ha tenido un papel central en la composición de la población. Usamos la perspectiva teorética general de Kalmijn (1998) que enfatiza la forma en que la estructura de oportunidades y los factores de terceras personas afectan la tasa de matrimonios intergrupales. Más específicamente, hacemos la hipótesis que la tasa de matrimonios intergrupales está influida por: (1) las oportunidades estructurales que se ven reflejadas en la historia de la inigualdad, segregación y opresión racial, (2) otros intereses como lo son las diferencias linguísticas y culturales, y (3) las corrientes sociales que reflejan preferencias en la formación de relaciones íntimas y en la igualdad racial. Usamos la edad como un substituto por las tendencias manifestadas a través del tiempo. Primero utilizamos modelos logolineales para calcular la tasa de homogamia general y la de homogamia racial específica de cada medio cultural. Después usamos regresión logística multinomial para evaluar la diferencia de edades. Las diferencias crosculturales en las tasas de matrimonios intergrupales son sustanciales. El matrimonio intergrupal es más común en las sociedades en los que las oportunidades estructurales para el contacto son altas y en la que otros intereses son bajos (como en Hawai y en Nueva Zelanda); es casi inexistente entre algunos grupos en sociedades en que existen fuertes tensiones intergrupales (Provincia de Xinjiang, China y Sudáfrica) y es intermedio en sociedades con grados moderados de oportunidades y otros intereses (Estados Unidos y Canadá). La edad, con algunas excepciones interesantes, tiene generalmente asociaciones negativas con el matrimonio intergrupal. El matrimonio interracial en general se está haciendo más común en las\_zonas examinadas.},

We identify a number of ascribed and achieved characteristics that are viewed as resources available for exchange, both as complements and substitutes. We apply conditional logit models to show how patterns of assortative mating among never-married and previously married persons are subject to local marriage market opportunities and constraints. The results reveal that previously married individuals “cast a wider net”: spousal pairings are more heterogamous among remarriages than among first marriages. Marital heterogamy, however, is reflected in systematic evidence of trade-offs showing that marriage order (i.e., status of being never-married) is a valued trait for exchange. Never-married persons are better positioned than previously married persons to marry more attractive marital partners, variously measured (e.g., highly educated partners). Previously married persons—especially women—are disadvantaged in the marriage market, facing demographic shortages of potential partners to marry. Marriage market constraints take demographic expression in low remarriage rates and in heterogamous patterns of mate selection in which previously married partners often substitute other valued characteristics in marriage with never-married persons.},

This article reformulated these concepts; introduces a new, more general conceptual distinction between reciprocated and unreciprocated mobility; and matches the concepts of structure and exchange to parameters of the model of quasi symmetry (QS). Specifically, if exchange or reciprocated mobility is defined as that part of the mobility process that results from equal flows between pairs of occupational categories, and if structural mobility is defined as an effect of marginal heterogeneity that operates uniformly on origins, then (if QS or any special case of QS holds) there is a correspondence between the parameter of the model and the concepts of structure and exchange. Furthermore, this correspondence can be used to develop meaningful parametric (as opposed to ad hoc) indexes of structural mobility. However, if QS fails to hold, there is at best a partial correspondence between the concepts of structure and exchange and the parameters of any multiplicative model. Data from Brazil, Great Britain, and the United States are used to illustrate the article's approach.},

	abstract = {The effect of socioeconomic background on occupational attainment is well established. But the effect of status does not account for all of the association between occupational origins and destinations. The amount of autonomy accorded to workers and the degree of specialization in the training required of them are also important for mobility. Men whose fathers were entrepreneurs or were employed in other positions that require little supervision are more likely than men whose fathers were closely supervised to enter occupations that offer at least some degree of on-the-job autonomy. Autonomy and training are especially important for immobility. Men whose fathers were autonomous or specially trained are more likely than other men to be immobile. A model incorporating the effects of socioeconomic status, on-the-job autonomy, and specialized training is fitted to the 1962 and 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation data. The models fits the data well with few parameters. Subpopulations defined by race, age, and education are also analyzed. The analysis provides new insight into the weakening of the association between origins and destinations between 1962 and 1973, the convergence of black and white mobility patterns, and the role of education as an intervening variable in the mobility process.},

	abstract = {Objective Several recent studies have investigated the consequences of racial intermarriage for marital stability. None of these studies properly control for first-order racial differences in divorce risk, therefore failing to appropriately identify the effect of intermarriage. Our article builds on an earlier generation of studies to develop a model that appropriately identifies the consequences of crossing racial boundaries in matrimony. Methods We analyze the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth using a parametric event-history model called a sickle model. To appropriately identify the effect of interracial marriage we use the interaction of wife's race and husband's race. Results We find elevated divorce rates for Latino/white intermarriages but not for black/white intermarriages. Seventy-two percent of endogamous Latino marriages remain intact at 15 years, but only 58 percent of Latino husband/white wife and 64 percent of white husband/Latina wife marriages are still intact. Conclusions We have identified an important deficiency in previous studies and provide a straightforward resolution. Although higher rates of Latino/white intermarriage may indicate more porous group boundaries, the greater instability of these marriages suggests that these boundaries remain resilient.},

	abstract = {Newly released census microdata reveal the nearly worldwide and substantial decline in educational hypergamy (women marrying men with higher educational attainment) across 56 countries from the 1970s to the 2000s. We examine the extent to which the observed decrease in hypergamy is connected to the worldwide rise in female educational attainment. Our results show that educational hypergamy is an enduring form of gender inequality in union formation across the countries examined but that it has been decreasing over the last few decades and in some countries has reversed in recent years. Overall, we find a strong association between hypergamy and gender differences in educational attainment. Societies in which the female educational advantage is greater tend to have lower levels of educational hypergamy. There is a tendency toward a joint increase in women's educational levels and a decrease in educational hypergamy. This article underlines the influence of women's educational opportunities on the increase in gender symmetry in assortative mating, which leads us to predict the end of educational hypergamy.},

However, it is hard to refute the possibility that other factors correlated with skin tones might affect employment outcomes. To overcome this inherent limitation, we use a natural experiment: we utilize changes in one’s own skin tone, generated by exposure to the sun, to explore the effect of skin tone on the tendency to be employed. We find that those people whose skin tone becomes darker by exposure to the sun (but not others) are less likely to be employed when the UV radiation in the previous three weeks in the area in which they reside is greater. These within-person findings hold even when controlling for the week, the year, the region, demographic characteristics and the occupation and industry one is employed in.},

The most sophisticated of these inquiries adjust observed intermarriage rates for individualsÕ opportunities to meet a potential spouse from a given racial group. In this paper we argue that most of these national estimates of homogamy–heterogamy odds ratios fail to account for variation in racial composition across marriage markets. As a result, geographic constraints on interracial marriage are misinterpreted as evidence of social distance between groups. Using data from the 1990 census, we ﬁnd that national estimates of race eﬀects on partnering decline by between 19 and 53 percent once we control for the racial composition of local marriage markets, as opposed to the racial composition of the US. We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for estimates of the social distance between racial groups, as well as for studies of other forms of intermarriage.},

	abstract = {The "two-sex problem" is one of attempting to preserve the essential character of male and female rates of marriage (or birth), since the expression of those rates is influenced both by the age-sex composition of the population and the underlying age-sex schedule of preferences. The present paper focuses on marriage and advances a theoretically based, realistic, and conceptually simple solution. In the continuous case, where exact male and female ages are used, equation (11) provides a mathematical relationship which equates the sum of the male and female marriage propensities of the observed population with that of the model. When discrete age intervals are used, the two-sex consistency condition is given by equation (14) which equates observed and model population rates calculated using the harmonic means of the number of persons in the relevant male and female age groups. The harmonic mean consistency condition is shown to be fully sensitive to the competitive nature of the "marriage market." When compared with alternative approaches to the two-sex problem in the context of data for Sweden, 1961-64, the simple harmonic mean method yields results fairly similar to those of the other methods. None of the two-sex methods do particularly well at predicting the actual distribution of marriages, however. The likely reason is that the underlying marriage preferences changed, a circumstance which emphasizes the importance of carefully conceptualizing how observed behavior can be decomposed into the effects produced by age-sex composition and those produced by the underlying preferences.},
