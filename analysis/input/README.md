# Input Directory

All of the data for this project come from Census and American Community Survey (ACS) extracts from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org). Data come in gzipped fixed-width format files. The ACS data is split into several smaller extracts by year to avoid problems with GitHub's file size limits. All raw data is gzipped to keep file size down. 

This directory also contains a shapefile from the [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) on MSA boundaries that was used for a figure in some of the analysis.
